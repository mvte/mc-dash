dashboard for play.mvte.net

## setup
make sure you are on node 16

### frontend
1. open terminal in `client/`
2. run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. then run `npm start`
4. see website in http://localhost:3000

### backend
there's nothing here yet so just sit tight \
but if you want you can do `cd ../server` \
then run `npm i` to install dependencies

## plans
- login 
- figure out docker api to see resource usage
- maybe make our own api to see server stats
-
